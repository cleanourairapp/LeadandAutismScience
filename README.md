# LeadandAutismScience
Scientific Papers which may suggest a link between Autism and Lead exposure in Children. More research is needed on direct causation, but they most certainly do show a strong correlation between childhood Lead Exposure and the occurrence of Autism. 

To quote the authors of the study [Ref. 1]: "The study showed a significant elevation in the levels of toxic metals Lead and Mercury in both hair and nail samples of autistic children when compared to healthy control group."

While a direct link between Lead Exposure and Autism is still being studied, we can most certainly say that these works found a positive correlation between childhood Lead levels and the occurence of Autism and/or Autism-related symptoms. And it has most certainly been proven that Lead has a number of other harmful effects, such as harming mental development in children. The fact that lead-emmitting private planes are allowed to fly over our heads is an abomination.

(Study suggesting correlation between higher blood levels of toxins such as Lead, Mercury and Copper and a greater severity in the degree of Autism. Also the quoted study, phrasing of quote slightly modifies to be easier for common reader to interpret, with p-value being removed and periodic table notation being changed to common names)

(Note that the SMD (95% CI) for Lead was 2.81 compared to that of 1.96 for Mercury, while lead also had a more statistically relevant p-value. This may suggest - or be interpreted to suggest - that Lead is more culpable in the causation of Autism than even Mercury. This study was published in 2020, so more research is still needed.)
